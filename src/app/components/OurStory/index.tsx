        Four years ran so quickly, we looked at what we’ve built and found it beautiful, we saw how mighty our love-tree has grown,
        while we marvel at the journey we’ve walked, Sam surprisingly popped the big question “Will you marry me and walk forever with me?”
        with one knee down and a ring in his right hand waiting for a resounding YES that finally came after the shock and drama from Priscilla due to the unsuspected timing,
        circumstance and place.
        Here we are, about to give the final and continuing “YES, I DO” to a forever of love, friendship, and companionship.
